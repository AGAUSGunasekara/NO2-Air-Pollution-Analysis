# NO2-Air-Pollution-Analysis
This project examines the impact of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) pollution in WHO member countries between 2010 and 2019 using Machine Learning techniques. The study applies a Random Forest Regressor model, achieving exceptional predictive accuracy (MSE: 0.00545, R²: 0.99996) in evaluating NO₂ concentration trends. Findings indicate a general decline in NO₂ pollution over time, though some countries—such as Bahrain and Lebanon—still exhibit high pollution levels, necessitating targeted intervention measures.
